Right now we only have profile images:

They are stored using the filename that they go by in the
public/uploads/ folder.
So in the database it would look like:

email: jj@gmail.com
password: pass
...
profileimage: 0b06d7d1905f42e1d6389b4728e062d7

They are placed in this folder when dropped or uploaded into
the Dropzone.
